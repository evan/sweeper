== Features

* faster than MusicBrainz
* better results than MusicBrainz
* smart genre tagging

<b>WARNING: This is beta software. Backup your music collection first.</b>

== Requirements

* Linux, Intel OS X, or Windows
* Ruby and Rubygems
* id3lib (Linux and OS X only)
* some mp3 files

== Installation

<b>Linux/OS X:</b>

Install id3lib, Ruby, and Rubygems through your package manager. Then start a terminal and run:
  sudo gem install sweeper

<b>Windows:</b>

If you have Ruby set up via the {One-Click Installer}[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/], you can install via Rubygems as above.

Otherwise, download a zipfile from the appropriate section of the {Rubyforge page}[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2835]. Unzip it and copy <tt>sweeper.exe</tt> into the <tt>C:\Windows</tt> folder.

== Usage

Now, start a terminal. Change to the directory of mp3s you want to tag and run:
  sweeper --genre --recursive

Your mp3s will be updated with missing artist, genre, and trackname information, and a list of all tagged genres will be added to the <tt>comment</tt> field, for use in smart playlists.

You do not need a Last.fm account to use Sweeper.

== Demo

Unknown song:

  $ id3info 1_001.mp3
  *** Tag information for 1_001.mp3
  *** mp3 info

  Bitrate: 128KBps
  Frequency: 44KHz

Same song after running <tt>sweeper ----genre</tt>:

  $ id3info 1_001.mp3

== Options

Sweeper takes a few command line options:

    -d, --dir            Directory to search (defaults to current).
    -r, --recursive      Recurse directories.
        --dry-run        Do a dry run (no files will be changed).
    -f, --force          Overwrite all existing tags.
    -g, --genre=[force]  Add genre tag and genre comments, optionally overwriting
                         existing ones.

== Notes

You will get cleaner tags if you convert your files to ID3v2 first. Sweeper reads both tag versions, but only outputs ID3v2.
